# StocksWatchlist
Application that allows you to add stocks to a list, attach descriptions to them and observe their daily price movements for the past year on a candlestick chart. It allows users to add any ticker that is currently available on Yahoo Finance and displays their last close or current price.<br>

I made a simple linked list and array library that the app uses to store the data and implemented searching and sorting algorithms as a part of the requirements for the assessment, otherwise, the application could use built-in algorithms and data structures instead.
